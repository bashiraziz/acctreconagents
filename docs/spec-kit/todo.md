# Spec-Kit TODO List

- [ ] Upload sample GL/subledger CSVs that mirror real customer exports for quick demos.
- [ ] Add inline helper copy that links each required column to the Spec-Kit definition.
- [ ] Script orchestrator smoke tests (`npm run test:orchestrator`) that validate schema + multi-agent flow.
- [ ] Stand up memory-safe storage for uploaded files (Azure Blob or AWS S3) with signed URLs.
- [ ] Document ChatKit workflow setup (API keys, workflow IDs, troubleshooting) inside `/docs/api/chatkit.md`.
