# Unbilled/WIP Detail

Pair these files with the revenue recognition dataset to test mapping between unbilled receivables and GL control accounts.

| File | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `unbilled_detail_balanced.csv` | Open WIP items that tie to GL 12050. |
| `unbilled_detail_variance.csv` | Includes a stale milestone (should have been billed) so unbilled is overstated by $32k.
